<h1>User registration/login system</h1>
<hr><h3>User registration/login system made with Node.js, React and MySQL</h3>
</br><p>It allows the user to create an account and then login into it.<br/>
When the user is successfully logined they can load up a user list that contains all the users from the database. It uses JSON Web Token for user authentication while making a request to get user list.
<br/> It also uses cookies to keep the user loginned even if they closed the browser tab. <br/>
During the development of this project I learned how to authorize and authenticate a user with NodeJS and React. I also practiced my TypeScript skills because frontend and backend are written in TypeScript. This was my first time using TypeScript with Node.js</p><h2>Technologies Used</h2>
